Loan project
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and reliable model for automating the loan approval decision-making process. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of predicting loan approval outcomes based on diverse applicant features.
Methodology:
The project employs a comprehensive approach, experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable model for accurate classification. The performance of these models is rigorously evaluated using k-fold cross-validation techniques, ensuring robustness and reliability in the assessment process.
Results:
The outcomes of this project provide insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in the context of loan approval prediction. By measuring accuracy through k-fold cross-validation, the project offers a quantitative understanding of the model's performance, aiding in the selection of the most suitable algorithm for real-world application.
The features of this project include:
Columns:
Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan application.
Gender: Applicant's gender.
Married: Applicant's marital status.
Dependents: Number of dependents on the applicant.
Education: Applicant's level of education.
Self_Employed: Indicates whether the applicant is self-employed.
ApplicantIncome: Monthly income of the applicant.
CoapplicantIncome: Monthly income of the co-applicant (if any).
LoanAmount: The requested loan amount.
Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months.
Credit_History: Credit history of the applicant (binary: 1 for good, 0 for bad).
Property_Area: Area of property for which the loan is requested.
Loan_Status: Outcome of the loan approval (Y for approved, N for not approved).
Based on all of the above features the model does the loan approval process.
